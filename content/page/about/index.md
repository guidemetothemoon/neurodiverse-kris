Hello and thank you for joining my neurodiversity corner üê±

My name's Kris, I'm a software engineer and for many years I've been in a daily battle with mental health disorders. Falling, standing up, failing and learning from it, being ready to give up and finally speaking up, seeking help and getting help and support that put me on a lifelong journey of recovery, self-care and healing. This journey is not finished and I haven't fixed it all forever. I've realized that being neurodiverse is an essential piece of what makes me who I am, and I'm in a continuous, daily work with myself to transform this to my **strength** instead of weakness.

Being neurodiverse can be quite lonely, even when you're among many people. In addition there's still this stigma in the society that mental health challenges must be kept to oneself and not discussed publicly, but I would like to contribute to changing this. We must **NOT** only talk about this on a mental health awareness day. We must **NOT** only lift our sight and ask "How are you doing really?" on a mental health awareness day. We must do it **EVERY DAY**. And we must take care of ourselves and our own mental health every day. *"Put your oxygen mask on first, before helping others"* - we know this by heart, but it also stands for our health, mental and physical.

Therefore I would like to use this neurodiversity corner to share my personal journey, my thoughts on the topics of neurodiversity and mental health, things I tried out and what did and didn't work for me, etc. I've seen a lot of engagement and positive feedback on posts I shared on this topic on social media which inspired me to start writing about it consistently on a dedicated platform. I hope that by speaking out, sharing what I'm going through I can make it relatable for others, help others feel less alone and maybe even inspire others to keep fighting and trying out things that were helpful for me.

‚ö†Ô∏è Finally, I would like to point out that **blog posts on this website represent my personal views and thoughts and don't provide medical advice**. Eventual official resources that I will be referencing in some of the blog posts will have the respective links to the official source where you can find more information on the topic.

Rounding up, here's your daily reminder: **YOU** are beautiful. **YOU** are unique. And **YOU** are **GOOD ENOUGH** üåü

If you've read this far, thank you for your time üíö

*- Warm hug from Neurodiverse Kris ü™∑*
